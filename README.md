Dataset
The dataset contains information about various medicines, including their names, categories, dosage forms, strengths, manufacturers, indications, and classifications.

Columns:
Name: The name of the medicine.
Category: The therapeutic category of the medicine (e.g., antiviral, antibiotic).
Dosage Form: The form in which the medicine is administered (e.g., tablet, syrup).
Strength: The strength of the medicine (e.g., 500 mg).
Manufacturer: The company that manufactures the medicine.
Indication: The primary use or indication for the medicine (e.g., infection, pain).
Classification: Whether the medicine is over-the-counter or prescription.
Data Cleaning
The dataset undergoes several cleaning steps to ensure accuracy and consistency:

Handling Missing Values: Checking and handling any missing values.
Removing Duplicates: Ensuring there are no duplicate rows.
Data Type Conversion: Converting columns to appropriate data types.
Standardizing Data: Trimming whitespace and converting text to a consistent case.
Visualizations
Several visualizations are created to explore and understand the dataset:

Histogram for Strength:

Displays the distribution of medicine strengths.
Helps identify the central tendency and spread of the Strength values.
Bar Chart for Category:

Shows the count of medicines in each therapeutic category.
Helps compare the prevalence of different categories.
Pie Chart for Dosage Form:

Illustrates the proportion of each dosage form.
Provides insight into the balance of dosage forms in the dataset.
Box Plot for Strength:

Visualizes the distribution of Strength values.
Highlights outliers and shows the spread of the data.
